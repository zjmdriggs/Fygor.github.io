        Last week on Wednesday, my group and I went to the UC Bike Kitchen  and met two of the mechanics that work there. They were cordial and informative and we talked with them for an hour about the bike kitchen. The mechanics told us any UC student can rent a bike for two days or bring their own bike in for free repairs. The bike kitchen is part of the Office of Sustainability on campus, which is why they provide this free service to UC students. We also learned about films they show to educate students and cleaning up after football games. I also discovered that one of the mechanics, Chad, is part of the same university LOL (League of Legends) club that I am a member of.
	 Before visiting the UC Bike Kitchen, I hadn’t realized the that the purpose of their company isn’t for business or monetary gain; rather, it is to promote a more environmentally sustainable form of transportation. I think the goal of the UC Bike Kitchen is is valuable because of its eco-friendly message. This quote from the “Bike-sharing’s Impacts” section of Paul DeMaio’s article illustrate the positive results of bike sharing programs, “Bike-sharing has had profound affects on creating a larger cycling population, increasing transit use, decreasing greenhouse gases, and improving public health”. This experience also greatly impacted me because ever since taking AP environmental science last year in high school, I have a growing concern for the state of the environment. I am a sympathetic person, so the idea of using my volunteer hours to help promote sustainability at UC is worthwhile to me.
	I will recommend the UC Bike Kitchen to people I know since it is a resource that many students aren’t aware of. It’s important
for people to know since it will increase their personal use of the bikes, saving them money and decreasing the  reliance on driving for UC students. I am also planning on getting involved with the UC Bike kitchen and UC sustainability by donating service hours and attending events. I have already visited the farmers market on Thursday, which is an event they organized, and I followed both organizations on Facebook. I’m also going to connect with Chad at the next UC LOL meeting and learn more about UC Sustainability from him. Hopefully, this will increase my attendance and enjoyment of both UC LOL and UC Sustainability.
      <h1 align="center">Final Reflection</h1>
        The vision of the UHP is to develop students into global citizen scholars who lead innovative efforts toward solving the world’s complex problems. To me, a global citizen scholar is a person who is informed and knowledgable applying what they know to improve the state of the communities they are a part of, ranging from clubs, to cities, to countries, to the world. I will always consider my strengths, values, interests by keeping them written down and stored with me. I will pick activites and join groups that can best utilize my strengths and allign with my interests and values. I will carry the skill of reflection beyond the University Honors Program and integrate it into my life. I want to stay active in the clubs I have joined my freshman year through out my college career, developing and improving with them. Focusing my honors experiences on contributing to the University League of Legends Club and I want to become an active engaged member of the UC Sustainability program.
