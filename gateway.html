        <h1 align="center">Mini Experience</h1>
        After being sorted into different groups based on the thematic areas recognized in the UHP, then divided again because too many people felt that Research was their best fit, we finally gathered our small group and started looking for our mini-experience. We decided to sit in on a keynote speech at a research symposium over at the UC medical campus, which was delivered by Judy H. Cho, MD, and was about both her career accomplishments and a glimpse into the option of becoming a physician researcher. One of the biggest things about the experience I learned happened even before Dr. Cho started speaking. It was arriving at the medical campus, of all things. Even though both campuses wore the UC badge, I felt like I didn’t belong there the moment I stepped foot out of the car. It wasn’t necessarily a bad feeling, though. This was an experience for one of the subgroups under the Research banner, and even then I was somewhat of an odd man out given that the other group members tended to be STEM type majors, whereas I am in IT. Then when we all went to this symposium I realized that Research didn’t even necessarily mean lab work, but anything where you can learn or find something new. By stepping out of my comfort zone, even for an hour, I was able to learn about a topic I wasn’t even really aware of or cared about (what a shock, I’m not passionate about IBS), and gave me a little insight into the world of exploring unfamiliar situations.

      <h1 align="center">Final Review</h1>
      To me, a global citizen scholar is someone who takes what they have learned beforehand and goes out into the world armed with that knowledge to both put it to use and learn even more, perpetuating the cycle. With the tools and desires to learn and use my knowledge firmly ingrained into my personality, I aim to experience more of the world to see how people live, learn what they do and what drives them, and hopefully improve some lives along the way. This could happen anywhere: at home with my family, out in the neighborhood, on campus, or on a larger scale, state, country, or the world as a whole.
