        <p>
          As part of the University Honors Program (UHP) at the University of
          Cincinnati, I took the <a href="https://www.uc.edu/honors/students/firstyear/gateway.html">Gateway to University Honors</a>
          course for Fall semester 2016. This course is, as stated by the website:
          "Gateway to University Honors provides students with the opportunity
          to understand what it means to be a member of the University Honors
          Program and the requirements and benefits of their participation.
          Through a series of reflective assignments and discussions, students
          will begin to explore how they want to make the most of their time at
          the University of Cincinnati and beyond."

        <h1 align='center'>Mini Experience</h1>
        <p>
          For our experience, our group attended a talk on Non Human Persons
          talk on October 21st, 2016 by Christina Andrews from York University.
          I am not the best at working in groups and had a bit of difficulty
          organizing and communicating with the five people in my group on one
          experience we all wanted. This talk to me did not seem like a research
          talk; and, after attending the talk, I still believe that this was not
          a research experience. The presentation was extremely vague in
          describing the data and research as it has not been completed yet and
          the presentation only laid out goals and ideas for the project
          described why the topic is important. Although I did not expect to,
          I enjoyed the project and topic and talked to the speaker after the
          presentation ended for a good 20 to 30 minutes in an attempt to better
          understand why she was so passionate about the protection of animals.
          This is a new field and I always enjoy looking into new topic and
          learning more about them.
        </p>
        <p>
	        Not what I had originally expected, I still enjoyed the experience and
          was able to learn about an interesting topic. This makes my sound
          arrogant putting myself above my classmates but I just cannot stand
          how they believe can brush aside my frustration at their seemingly
          unreasonable topic choice; then simply tell me to go along with the
          idea because the rest of the group agrees on its validity. My purpose
          in taking this course and trying new experiences is to learn more
          about myself and if I cannot understand the premise of a subject, I
          will never understand myself and my groupmates trying to brush that
          asides still irks me extraordinarily. I must not let myself become
          livid over this; the distinction between my interest and the rest of
          the groups was shown during the presentation. Some of the people in my
          group left early or just as the talk ended while I stayed behind to
          discuss the topic with the speaker after the time for questions ended
          because I wanted to learn why the treatment of non human persons is
          important. This extra learning and growth is what I enjoy, even if the
          topic is something I did not initially expect or want. I am not better
          than my classmates, I simply view the world differently and approach
          challenges in my own manner; not inherently better or worse, simply
          different.

          As a Global Citizen Scholar I will endeavor to improve the lives of
          those around me by completing work in my field. While working, I will
          hopefully continue adding work to the public domain, while helping to
          tutor and develop more curriculum for students. As part of the UHP
          program at UC, I will continue doing research, making new open source
          projects, and exploring opportunities to do community service and help
          teach in my local community. I do not wish to make some ground
          breaking discovery, but implement and improve upon the work that many
          other people have already completed. There is a world of possibilities
          and I hope to use my time in academia to explore more about my field
          and identify what I want to pursue within Computer Science.
