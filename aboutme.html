              As you may know by now, my name is Zachary Driggs. I have a particular fondness for learning new things, whether or not they are relevant or useful in any way, and have been this way most of my life. I am part of a Dungeons and Dragons group on campus, I play all sorts of video games like League of Legends and Terraria, and I enjoy reading. In high school, I started taking Latin, which lasted through all 4 years, ending with AP Latin. During this time I came to realize one of my favorite things that I enjoyed learning, and it is something I could definitely see myself using in the UHP as well as the rest of my life: Languages and Culture. These two categories of things to learn are the best things to utilize the UHP for, as there is a myriad of options available and a plethora of resources. There are language courses to take, study abroad/study tours, and even co-op opportunities that I will certainly be looking into.

            <p>
              Deliberative, Intellection, Input, and Analytical. These categorical words describe the core of who I am. I choose my battles carefully, and find the best solution for each, I like to think and I enjoy consistent mental activity, I collect information constantly, and I analyze what’s being said or what I read in order to see things from multiple perspectives. These traits blend well with my desire to learn about other cultures, and may help to explain why. Intellection is probably the biggest mirror, as the mental activity required to process languages and cultures that are entirely different to the one you are used to can be quite the workout, but others like Deliberative and Analytical help me to see the world from multiple views instead of solely my own.
