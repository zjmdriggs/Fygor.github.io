            <p>
              I am an Architecture student at the University of
                Cincinnati with an expected graduation in Spring 2020 and I graduated from Lakota West High school. I am a triplet.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have learned a lot from growing up with my siblings by my side and they helped me develop my interests and passions. My brother introduced me to League of Legends which is a video game I have been playing for many years and my sister joined stage crew with me which I stayed an active member in throughout high school. These are two interests I am eager to explore through UHP.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am an empathetic and caring person who is skilled in understanding how people develop and improve as individuals. This will help me lead a League of Legends team and help build a better League of Legends community at UC. This will also motivate me to help improve theatre clubs I am planning on becoming an active member in during my time at UC. My interests in League of Leagues and Stage Crew paired with my strength of developing and wanting to help people and my value of fairness and harmony will come together to allow me to improve and support the existing communities at UC and make a space for to thrive and feel accepted at UC.
