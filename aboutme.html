          My interests include piano, video editing, programming and education.
          Below is a youtube video I made of myself playing piano from June 2016.
          Many of the project I work on reflect my interests and I have made
          an entire page on this website dedicated to this, the <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>.
          The following video shows my interests and exemplifies what I have
          been able to do over the past few years.

        <p>
          While volunteering at Hughes High School, when I walked into class one
          day, the instructor I assist and a student I was working with both
          looked up in disbelief; I did not know this at the time, but the
          student had just asked the teacher, “how does Nick go about solving
          these problems”, then I appeared in the room. I am dedicated to my
          work and have participated in many projects over the last few years.
          These activities have ranged from independent work, to research
          projects, to volunteering at local high schools. I aspire to better
          myself and those around me through the use of technology and education.
           My strengths allow me to focus and work independently. However, I
           realize the benefits of group work and have been trying to adapt and
           improve my ability to work in a group. To accomplish this, I have
           been attempting to document and collaborate more while working.
         </p>
         <p>
           My strengths also allow me to better reflect on work I have done. Now
            that I have started using Github to document and track my projects,
            I can much more easily review previous projects and see the benefits
            of my work. My passion to help others and learn about computer
            science have become more and more integrated in the past years. I
            will in future try to explore this opportunity and look forward to
            helping the students at Hughes High School. Many of my other
            projects have also been geared toward helping other people and
            improving education. It is not my goal in life to be an educator,
            but I have a passion for learning and teaching just as I have a
            passion for computer science and cryptography and hope to use
            college as an opportunity to explore these interests.
